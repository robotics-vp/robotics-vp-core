Phase G Summary: Becoming a Learnable, Modular Economic Engine

Phase G transforms your ecosystem from:

“a vertical fountain of deterministic heuristics”

into

“a learnable platform with sovereign econ/datapack layers, a semantic spine, and fully modular policy surfaces.”

This is the clean interface boundary needed so that:

RECAP VLA can be plugged in

Meta-transformer can be trained end-to-end

Isaac can be fully integrated

Phase 4 synthetic data loop can optimize semantics

Phase 5 real-world economics can converge

Stage 2035 humanoid econ engine becomes real

Phase G ensures the platform is:

future-proof

learnable

fully observable

modular

economically interpretable

semantically coherent

RL-compatible

synthetic-data-ready

Isaac-portable

When Phase G is completed, the repo is no longer a robotics RL stack — it is a full economics-semantic-robotics engine, ready for neural upgrade.
