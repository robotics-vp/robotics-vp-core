# robotics-vp-core

Core codebase for the Robotics Video-to-Policy MPL Economics Engine.

## Overview
This repository contains the foundational modules for:
- Horizon-agnostic world model
- Diffusion-based video-to-policy transformation
- VLA data valuation system
- MPL economics reward shaping
- SIMA-2 co-learning agent integration
- Synthetic data generation and pricing

## Directory Structure
## Goals
- Build a unified robotics-economics training pipeline
- Integrate real and synthetic video into policy learning
- Attach marginal productivity and wage-parity rewards
- Perform attribution analysis on learned behavior
- Create a data-pricing engine for autonomous robots

## Status
Repository initialized. Modules will be implemented by Claude Code and Codex.
